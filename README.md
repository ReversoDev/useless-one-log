# one-log

This is the most fucking useless npm package....

If you are too lazy to type `console.log(1)` or whatever. Use this package.
You only need to require it once, and you can use it throughout your whole project.

Regular JS shit:
```js
require('useless-one-log');
one();
```

TypeScript stuff: (why did I add typings?)
```ts
import('useless-one-log');
one();
```
